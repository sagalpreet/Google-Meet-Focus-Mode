# Google Meet Focus Mode

Google Meet Focus Mode is just a piece of code that can be used to modify Google Meet browser window to allow for more focussed sessions.

  - All thats required is just a click
  - Only software required is the browser itself


### How to use

- Enter the google meet you are to attend
- Open up the console window.
  - For Chrome and Edge(Chromium), Ctrl + Shift + J does the same.
- Paste in the code and press enter.
- Now you are ready to go !
- You can toggle between the focus mode and normal window just by a single click in the browser viewport area.

### Development

Want to contribute? Great!

The current code base is very simple, easy to start with and contribute. The entire script is written in JavaScript.

- A significant contribution to start with could be to comment out the present code as you go through to improve the code readability since the script is hardly 30 lines of code.
- Another good contribution could be to develop browser extension.
- The current version works fine with Chrome and Chromium based MS Edge, you may check with other browsers and make the code fit for them as well.
- Open up an issue regarding anything you feel is not working as it should have or if you want a new feature to be implemented.
